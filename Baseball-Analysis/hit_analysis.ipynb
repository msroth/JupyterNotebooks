    "**Batter Spray Charts**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook generates a spray chart showing away and home team batting results for a specified game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field dimensions are notional becuase every ball park is different and not symetrical.  The assumptions are that both the left and right foul poles are about 320' from home plate and the straight away wall in centerfield is 400'.  A smooth arc connects the 400' centerfield point to each foul pole.  This is not the case in most ball parks.  Thus, some home runs may not appear to clear the park, where other hits may seem to be over the fence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The infield arc is also notional but provides a general demarkation between the infield and outfield.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pie wedge divisions are rougly 1/3 of the x-axis, which distorts the eveness of thier area when the outfield corners are considered.  Again, this is just an estimation to provide context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gist of this chart is to show the locations of hits (which is accurate) for each team so general trends and observations can be deduced when combined with other facts, such as pitcher-batter match ups, shifts, etc."
