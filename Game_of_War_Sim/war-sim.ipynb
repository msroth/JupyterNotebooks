    "# Game of War (cards) Simulation #\n",
    "Simulate the game of War (card game).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ths notebook will simulate playing the card came War.  It will play it _n_ number of times and report basic statistics at the end:  number of games played, number of hands played, number of wins by each player (would expect this to be roughly 50-50), and the number of wars waged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of players:  2\n",
    "Objective: Collect all of the cards in a standard card deck (excluding Jokers).\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "  1.  The entire deck of cards is dealt in an alternating fashion to each player (each player recieves 26 cards).\n",
    "  2.  Player 1 lays a card from the top of thier deck face up on the table.  Player 2 does the same.\n",
    "  3.  The card with the highest value wins the \"battle\". The winning player collects all of the cards and sets them aside, face down.  (Cards are valued 2 - A with 2 the lowest card and ace the highest.)\n",
    "  4.  This process continues until each player lays down a card of equal value.  This is a war!\n",
    "  5.  Procedures for a war:\n",
    "      a.  Each player lays down three cards face down.\n",
    "      b.  The fourth card is dealt face up.  The card with the highest value (same as rule #3) wins the war and collects all of the cards.\n",
    "      c.  It is possible that the fourth cards dealt could be of the same value, which incites an additional war.  In this case the process repeats (steps a and b).  The winner takes all of the cards.\n",
    "      d.  If a player does not have enough cards to complete the war (4 cards), they lose and the other player wins by default.\n",
    "  6.  When a player exhausts thier deck of cards, thier discard deck is played (without shuffling).\n"
